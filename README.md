# DL2025Project2
This is the NYU deep learning course mini-project for Parameter Efficient Finetuning of LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) for News Data
## Team 
- Feiyu Jia (netID: fj2182)
- Tianzan Min (netID: tm4485)
- Xiaoyu Liu (netID: xl5808)

## Overview
In this competition, your task is to build a text classification model fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to categorize news articles into one of four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. Youâ€™ll work with the classic AG News dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods on language models.
